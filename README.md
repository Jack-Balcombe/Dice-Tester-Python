# Dice-Tester
A simple little script I wrote to test the statistical validity of your physical dice. In short it will tell you if your dice are weighted towards rolling certain numbers.

It uses the Chi-Squared test which is explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test

To run just double click the Run.Bat file to launch the Dice-Tester.vbs console application. It will then walk you through the steps to test your dice and do the math for you.
